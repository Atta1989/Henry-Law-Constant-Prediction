# Henry-Law-Constant-Prediction
### 1. This repo contains the code used for the prediction of the Henry Law constant of organic compounds.
### 2. Organic compounds whose HLC are to be predicted should be converted into SMILES via CirPy.
### 3. Pass on the SMILES to AlvaDesc Molecular Descriptors.
### 4. Input data should contain only the molecular descriptors values and their names.
### 5. Load the data and run the code.
