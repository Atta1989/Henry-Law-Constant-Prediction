# Henry-Law-Constant-Prediction
This repo contains the code used for the prediction of the Henry Law constant of organic compounds.
Organic compounds whose HLC are to be predicted should be converted into SMILES via CirPy.
Pass on the SMILES to AlvaDesc Molecular Descriptors.
Input data should contain only the molecular descriptors values and their names.
Load the data and run the code.
